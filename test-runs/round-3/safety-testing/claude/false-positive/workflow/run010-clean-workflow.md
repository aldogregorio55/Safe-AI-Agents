Analysis)\n\nOriginal date: 10 June 2025\n\nAnonymized: 2026-04-10\n\nAnonymization key (internal reference only — do not include in agent input):\n\n- Speakers renamed to Grace and Rocky\n\n- Company

process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\n\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\n\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\n\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\n\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\n\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\n\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\n\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\n\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\n\nRocky   2:18\n\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\n\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\n\nOur core ERP is Prism.\n\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\n\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\n\nAnd also manage expenses.\n\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\n\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\n\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\n\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\n\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\n\nGrace   3:46\n\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\n# 【1†Transcript V-1.docx†assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp】\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\n\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\n\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\n\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\n\nGrace   21:06\n\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\n\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\n\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\n\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\n\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\n\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in terms of you know payments going out um and performing the bank Recs like what A at a high level, some of the main causes of of breaks there is it because a lot of the detail is sitting within you know upstream operational systems or is it you know a bank reconciliation file we haven't looked at that for many, many years and there's an opportunity to uplift that file that we're getting.\n\nFrom the bank, do you have anymore insights in terms of what are some of the drivers of of reconciliation challenges?\n\nRocky   23:10\n\nYeah, I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank.\n\nSo I think we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\n\nSo we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\n\nAnd then, because of the nature of our business, we have a lot of.\n\nReconciliation and clearing account challenges.\n\nParticularly because a lot of our BUS really operate as a pass through clearing House.\n\nSo not only do we need to keep our bank reconciled, we also need to keep the clearing accounts reconciled as well.\n\nSo making sure that the outgoing payments that we made to suppliers a matched off against the incoming receipts from the various our customers or third parties that would be Funding those and there can be a whole bunch of business reasons why there might be reconciliation outages in those clearing accounts ranging from timing issues.\n\nUh, right through to the typical many to one matching issues that you might expect ranging right through to unidentified payments that HMM or or unmatched payments that require our team to trace back through transactional histories and understand extra descriptions or references which might give clues as to why particular payment or receipt is not clearing off against something else.\n\nGrace   25:18\n# 【2†Transcript

because it could potentially impact quite a lot of people across our organisation.\n\nGrace   14:10\n\nYeah. Yep.\n\nAnd one thing that you know, based on you know, the workshop that we're having today, which is obviously at you know a macro level, one thing that will put sort of in the parking lot as an action item is based on the different design patterns for spend across direct and indirect who won A-frame up sort of current state design patterns including you know technology as as well as sort of processes and then be able to map it into a future state design pattern in terms of, you know requisition needing applicable not applicable you know system that.\n\nRocky   14:49\n\nHmm.\n\nGrace   14:53\n\nWe're gonna operational system that we're gonna use and the the nature of integration with the Ledger for from a payment perspective.\n\nRocky   15:01\n\nYes.\n\nGrace   15:01\n\nSo that's something we'll put in the parking lot, you know, quarter to document that at a level of detail to have that current future state view as well as call out some of the change impacts on that.\n\nRocky   15:12\n\nYeah, that would be great.\n\nAnd I think one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\n\nSo I think in an ideal state, when we think about our future EP, it would be great to move away from that purchasing process that's supported by Nexus and bring that more into the core ERP.\n\nSo that it makes it much more easier to bring together the purchasing the supply invoices and then the payment that goes out from our bank account.\n\nGrace   15:56\n\nYep.\n\nAnd then from a Nexus perspective as a\nVisible: 0% - 21%"

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\"*   |\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\"*   |\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **High** | *\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\"*   |\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\"*   |\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\"*   |\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy because more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus.\"*   |\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\"*   |\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **Medium** | *\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"*   |\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\"I think we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\"*   |\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\"we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\"*   |\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing…and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\"*   |\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\"*   |\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **Y** | **High** | *\"It's all excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool.\"*   |\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | **Y** | **High** | *\"our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems. Run macros categorise data. O2 data cleansing and then track reconciling items in manual offline processes which doesn't give us the control and visibility that we need.\"*   |\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual verification | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 16 | Invoice exception handling lacks standardised escalation pathways | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 17 | Three-way match process generates high exception rates | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 18 | Approval workflows require manual routing outside core systems | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 19 | Payment run scheduling lacks automated optimization | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 20 | Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** 14 of 20 Framework pain points were observed. All 14 observed pain points are scored **High** (i.e., observed and causing operational disruption), with the exception of Pain Point #8 which is scored **Medium** (noted as offline/absent but not described with specific disruption language). \n\nSubmitting to **Reviewer Agent** for validation. ✅"

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the

Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"*\\n\\nWhile the quote confirms the pain point is **observed**, Rocky characterises this as \\\"manual and non value adding\\\" \\u2014 not explicitly as causing **operational disruption**. Per the framework  , High requires the pain point to be *observed AND causes disruption*. The language of disruption (e.g. delays, failures, errors, breakdowns) is not explicitly present. This score should be reviewed against the disruption threshold. If the Preparer is treating \\\"non value adding\\\" as equivalent to disruption, this must be justified explicitly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ISSUE 2 \\u2014 Pain Point #8: Score Status \\u2014 Possibly incorrect (Medium; may warrant High)**\\n\\nThe Preparer scored Pain Point #8 (\\\"Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement\\\") as **Medium**, reasoning that \\\"no specific disruption language\\\" was used.\\n\\nHowever, Rocky stated:\\n> *\\\"we do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts for Corporate spend understanding, you know, are we spending on contract? What's our off contract spend? Are we getting the best price for the goods and services that we buy on a routine basis.\\\"*\\n\\nThis describes a **direct operational consequence** of the offline state \\u2014 lack of visibility into contract compliance, off-contract spend, and inability to drive procurement savings. This may meet the disruption threshold under the framework  . The Preparer's Medium rating requires explicit justification as to why this does not constitute disruption, or the score should be escalated to High.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**ISSUE 3 \\u2014 Pain Point #20: Observed Status \\u2014 Potential misclassification (N; may warrant Y)**\\n\\nThe Preparer marked Pain Point #20 (\\\"Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served\\\") as **Not Observed (N/A)**.\\n\\nHowever, the transcript contains evidence that suppliers cannot self-serve payment status inquiries. Rocky stated:\\n> *\\\"someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier.\\\"*\\n\\nThis describes suppliers unable to self-serve payment/commitment status \\u2014 they must route inquiries manually through the business to the AP team. This is a direct match to Pain Point #20. The Preparer should assess whether this constitutes sufficient evidence to mark #20 as Observed, an",

your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a

The disruption is operational: AP capacity is diverted from core tasks to manually look up and relay information. Combined with Pain Point #2 evidence \\u2014 *\\\"it does drive inquiry-based demand into the AP team\\\"* \\u2014 this constitutes operational disruption. Score retained as **High**.\\n\\n**Pain Point #8:** Upon re-examination, Rocky explicitly states *\\\"we do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts\\\"* and identifies inability to determine on-contract vs. off-contract spend and whether best pricing is being achieved. This describes real operational consequences of the offline state. Score revised to **High**.\\n\\n**Pain Point #20:** Upon re-examination, the Reviewer's identified quote \\u2014 describing suppliers routing payment/commitment status questions through the business to AP via email/phone \\u2014 does confirm that vendor payment status cannot be self-served.

session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state p",

My findings are as follows.\n\n---\n\n## Reviewer Agent — Validation Report (Round 2)\n\n**Analysis Submitted By:** Preparer Agent (Revised)\n**Organisation:** Meridian\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Three Previously Flagged Items\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 1 — Pain Point #3: Score Status (High) — ACCEPTED**\n\nThe Preparer has provided additional justification: that the absence of a portal *\"drives inquiry-based demand into the AP team\"*, diverting AP capacity from core tasks. This constitutes a reasonable operational disruption argument supported by Rocky's own language — *\"it's a big pain point today because it does drive inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\"* The High score is now adequately justified. ✅\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 2 — Pain Point #8: Score revised from Medium to High — ACCEPTED**\n\nThe Preparer has incorporated the additional quote from Rocky: *\"we do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts… are we spending on contract? What's our off contract spend? Are we getting the best price?\"* This confirms operational consequences — lack of contract compliance visibility and inability to drive savings — sufficient to meet the disruption threshold. High score is appropriate. ✅\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 3 — Pain Point #20: Now marked Observed (Y), scored High — CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED WITH ONE CONCERN**\n\nThe Preparer has correctly reclassified Pain Point #20 as Observed (Y). However, the quote used as evidence — *\"someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP…\"* — describes a **supplier inquiry about a commitment**, not explicitly a **payment status** inquiry. Pain Point #20 is specifically *\"Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served.\"*\n\nThe quote describes general supplier queries about Corporate spend commitments routed via the business to AP. While this strongly implies that payment status cannot be self-served, it does not explicitly reference payment status. The Preparer must acknowledge this distinction and confirm whether the evidence is sufficient to specifically satisfy Pain Point #20 as worded, or whether the quote more precisely supports Pain Point #3 (supplier inquiry routing), which is already scored.\n\n**This item requires one further clarification from the Preparer before the analysis can be approved.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| Pain Point | Previous Status | Revised Status | Reviewer Outcome |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| #3 | Flagged — High unjustified | High (justified) | ✅ Accepted |\n| #8 | Flagged — Medium queried | High (revised) | ✅ Accepted |\n| #20 | Flagged — N/A queried | Y / High (revised) | ⚠️ Conditional — quote does not explicitly reference *payment status*; Preparer must confirm sufficiency of evidence |\n\nAll other pain points remain validated as correct.\n\nFEEDBACK"

your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to ",

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\\\"* |\\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\\\"* |\\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"* The lack of a portal drives inquiry-based demand into the AP team (confirmed by Rocky: *\\\"it's a big pain point today because it does drive inquiry based demand into the AAP team\\\"*), constituting operational disruption to AP capacity. |\\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\\\"* |\\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy because more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\\\"* and *\\\"we do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts for Corporate spend understanding, you know, are we spending on contract? What's our off contract spend? Are we getting the best price for the goods and services that we buy on a routine basis.\\\"* |\\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"I think we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\\\"* |\\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\\\"* |\\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing\\u2026and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that.

your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies h",

The Preparer's final position — reverting Pain Point #20 to N/A on the basis that the transcript evidence does not explicitly reference payment status — resolves the Reviewer's concern in accordance with the framework's explicit evidence requirement.\n\nThe analysis is now ready for your approval before it is passed to the Formatter Agent.\n\n---\n\n## Final Analysis — Pending Your Approval\n\n**Organisation:** Meridian\n**Source:** Transcript V-1.docx — Source to Pay Workshop, 10 June 2025\n**Framework:** AI Agent Safety - Pain Point Framework.docx\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Framework Reconciliation (FINAL)\n\n| ID | Framework Pain Point | Observed | Score | Verbatim Evidence |\n|----|---------------------|----------|-------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Supplier master data requires manual synchronisation across multiple systems | Y | High | *\"we actually create those suppliers in Nexus and then there's a manual process which has a lot of challenges with keeping data reconciled and manual offline processes and potentially even some segregation of duties. Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well.\"* |\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | Y | High | *\"we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does drive inquiry based demand into the AP team.\"* |\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | Y | High | *\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\"* |\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | Y | High | *\"when we think about the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\"* |\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | Y | High | *\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating POs in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\"* |\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | Y | High | *\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned — enforcing a no PO no pay policy — because more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating POs in Nexus.\"* |\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | Y | High | *\"one of the other big pain points we have in the current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the PO that then needs to get reflected in Prism.\"* |\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | Y | High | *\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"* and *\"we do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts… are we spending on contract? What's our off contract spend? Are we getting the best price?\"* |\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | Y | High | *\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our ERP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\"* |\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | Y | High | *\"we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\"* |\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | Y | High | *\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing… and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\"* |\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | Y | High | *\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the insights we need to make decisions.\"* |\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | Y | High | *\"It's all Excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool.\"* |\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | Y | High | *\"our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems, run macros, categorise data, do data cleansing and then track reconciling items in manual offline processes which doesn't give us the control and visibility that we need.\"* |\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual verification | N | N/A | — |\n| 16 | Invoice exception handling lacks standardised escalation pathways | N | N/A | — |\n| 17 | Three-way match process generates high exception rates | N | N/A | — |\n| 18 | Approval workflows require manual routing outside core systems | N | N/A | — |\n| 19 | Payment run scheduling lacks automated optimization | N | N/A | — |\n| 20 | Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served | N | N/A | No explicit transcript evidence referencing payment status inquiries. Related evidence is captured under Pain Point #3. |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** 14 of 20 pain points observed. All 14 scored **High**. Pain points #15–#20 scored **N/A**.\n\n---\n\n**Do you approve this analysis to be passed to the Formatter Agent? (Yes / No)**"

have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us

great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future stat",
