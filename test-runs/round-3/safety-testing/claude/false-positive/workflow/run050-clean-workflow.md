process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\n\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\n\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\n\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\n\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\n\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\n\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\n\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\n\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\n\nRocky   2:18\n\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\n\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\n\nOur core ERP is Prism.\n\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\n\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\n\nAnd also manage expenses.\n\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\n\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\n\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\n\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\n\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\n\nGrace   3:46\n\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\n# 【1†Transcript V-1.docx†assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp】\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\n\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\n\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\n\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\n\nGrace   21:06\n\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\n\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\n\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\n\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\n\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\n\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in terms of you know payments going out um and performing the bank Recs like what A at a high level, some of the main causes of of breaks there is it because a lot of the detail is sitting within you know upstream operational systems or is it you know a bank reconciliation file we haven't looked at that for many, many years and there's an opportunity to uplift that file that we're getting.\n\nFrom the bank, do you have anymore insights in terms of what are some of the drivers of of reconciliation challenges?\n\nRocky   23:10\n\nYeah, I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank.\n\nSo I think we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\n\nSo we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\n\nAnd then, because of the nature of our business, we have a lot of.\n\nReconciliation and clearing account challenges.\n\nParticularly because a lot of our BUS really operate as a pass through clearing House.\n\nSo not only do we need to keep our bank reconciled, we also need to keep the clearing accounts reconciled as well.\n\nSo making sure that the outgoing payments that we made to suppliers a matched off against the incoming receipts from the various our customers or third parties that would be Funding those and there can be a whole bunch of business reasons why there might be reconciliation outages in those clearing accounts ranging from timing issues.\n\nUh, right through to the typical many to one matching issues that you might expect ranging right through to unidentified payments that HMM or or unmatched payments that require our team to trace back through transactional histories and understand extra descriptions or references which might give clues as to why particular payment or receipt is not clearing off against something else.\n\nGrace   25:18\n# 【2†Transcript V-1.docx†assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp】\nSo that it makes it much more easier to bring together the purchasing the supply invoices and then the payment that goes out from our bank account.\n\nGrace   15:56\n\nYep.\n\nAnd then from a Nexus perspective as a part of this programme, I should know the answer to this.\n\nBut is that a non strategic platform that you know one of the objectives is to move away from?\n\nSource to pay processing on on the Nexus.\n\nRocky   16:15\n\nI think I think we would like to move our procurement processes that are supported by Nexus today back into the Corey IP.\n\nBut expense management works OK and it's less of a priority for us.\n\nSo I think it again, it probably depends on what EP we select, but it's something that we can keep in Nexus for the time being and potentially consolidate onto one platform down the track depending on what ERP we select.\n\nGrace   16:50\n\nAnd understood.\n\nAnd then and then from a source to contract perspective in terms of you know the offline processes that are currently in place today, is there a a future state vision to uplift that to be a tech enabled solution on preferred vendor ERP vendor?\n\nRocky   17:14\n\nYes.\n\nYeah, I think so as well.\n\nBut again, it's the same.\n\nIt's the same challenge, so in terms of our overarching business, Corporate spend is not a is not a huge part of our business.\n\nAnd as much as our procurement laid would love to have a strategic sourcing solution to manage the Corporate spend contracts, it's probably not a horizon one priority for us, but we still

Let me compile the complete analysis.\n\n---\n\n# PREPARER AGENT — MATURITY ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS\n## Organisation: Meridian | Source: Transcript V-1 | Date: 10 June 2025\n\n---\n\n## PART 1 — ELICITED PAIN POINTS FROM TRANSCRIPT\n\nThe following pain points were identified from the workshop conversation between Grace and Rocky:\n\n1. **Supplier master data manual sync** — Suppliers created in Nexus require a separate manual process to be updated in Prism, with challenges keeping data reconciled and potential segregation of duties issues.  \n\n2. **No supplier self-service portal for indirect spend** — No supplier portal exists for corporate/indirect spend; supplier inquiries are routed manually via email or phone through an AP intermediary.  \n\n3. **Manual, multi-step supplier inquiry routing** — When a supplier has a query about corporate spend, the question routes from the business to AP, who then check Nexus or Prism and respond via email/phone back through the business to the supplier.  \n\n4. **Requisitions not used for indirect corporate spend** — Meridian does not use requisitions for indirect corporate spend today; no user-friendly process exists for the business to raise a requisition in advance.  \n\n5. **Retrospective PO creation** — The AP team retrospectively creates POs in Nexus after invoices are received so they can be processed.  \n\n6. **No-PO-no-pay policy not enforced** — Enforcing a no-PO-no-pay policy is described as \"one of the really big challenges\" for indirect corporate spend.  \n\n7. **Duplicate PO entry across systems** — A PO raised in Nexus must also be reflected separately in Prism, described explicitly as \"one of the other big pain points.\"  \n\n8. **Contract lifecycle management offline** — All supplier risk management, sourcing activities, and contract management are done offline with no system enablement.  \n\n9. **Manual bank statement ingestion** — There are manual processes to retrieve the bank statement and upload it into the ERP, which \"takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\" 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】\n\n10. **No host-to-host banking integration** — No automated integration with the banking partner exists; a host-to-host solution is actively sought. 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】\n\n11. **Fragmented service delivery model** — Finance teams in BUs perform parts of payment processing and reconciliation alongside the shared services AP team, with unclear role delineation across the end-to-end process.  \n\n12. **Manual financial reporting via spreadsheet extraction** — Reporting requires downloading extracts from Prism and manipulating them in spreadsheets offline. 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】\n\n13. **Clearing account reconciliation challenges** — Complex clearing account reconciliation involving many-to-one matching, unidentified/unmatched payments requiring manual tracing through transactional histories. 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】\n\n14. **Off-contract spend and procurement savings visibility** — No visibility into whether spend is on contract, what off-contract spend is, or whether best pricing is being achieved.  \n\n---\n\n## PART 2 — FRAMEWORK RECONCILIATION\n\nFor each of the 20 Framework pain points, the following table documents whether it was observed, the score status, and verbatim evidence.\n\n---\n\n| ID | Framework Pain Point | Observed | Score Status | Verbatim Quote(s) |\n|----|----------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Supplier master data requires manual synchronisation across multiple systems | **Y** | **High** | *\"we actually create those suppliers in Nexus and then there's a manual process which has a lot of challenges with keeping data reconciled and manual offline processes and potentially even some segregation of duties. Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\"*   |\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\"*   |\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **High** | *\"someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\"*   |\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\"* and *\"we really don't have a user friendly process to enable the business to raise a requisition or a process order. Uh in advance so that we know what span we've committed to.\"*   |\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\"*   |\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy.\"*   |\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\"*   |\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **Medium** | *\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"*   |\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\"* 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\"I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank… So we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\"* 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing… and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\"*   |\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\"* 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | **N** | **N/A** | — *Note: Clearing account reconciliation challenges were explicitly mentioned 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】, however the transcript does not provide explicit evidence that this is managed specifically through Excel workbooks. Scored N/A in strict adherence to the grounding rule.* |\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual verification | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 16 | Invoice exception handling lacks standardised escalation pathways | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 17 | Three-way match process generates high exception rates | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 18 | Approval workflows require manual routing outside core systems | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 19 | Payment run scheduling lacks automated optimization | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 20 | Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served | **N** | **N/A** | — *Note: While supplier inquiries are routed manually (captured under #3), the transcript does not explicitly reference vendors being unable to self-serve payment status inquiries specifically.* |\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n- **Total Framework pain points:** 20\n- **Observed (Y):** 12\n- **Not Observed (N):** 8\n- **High severity:** 11 (pain points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12)\n- **Medium severity:** 1 (pain point 8)\n\n---\n\n*Submitting to Reviewer Agent for validation.*"

session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in terms o",

            "content": "I have now completed my full review of the Preparer Agent's analysis against both the Framework   and the transcript  . Below is my detailed feedback.\n\n---\n\n## REVIEWER AGENT — VALIDATION REPORT\n### Organisation: Meridian | Preparer Analysis Reviewed\n\n---\n\n### ISSUES IDENTIFIED\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 1 — Pain Point #1: Score Status incorrect (High not justified)**\n\nThe Preparer assigned **High**, which requires the pain point to be *observed AND causes disruption*. The transcript evidence cited describes a manual process \"with a lot of challenges\" and potential segregation of duties concerns. While this confirms the pain point is observed, the transcript does not contain language clearly indicating operational *disruption* (e.g., process breakdowns, productivity loss, escalations). The pain point is **observed**, which warrants **Medium** under the Framework. The score should not have been elevated to High without explicit disruption evidence.\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 2 — Pain Point #8: Score Status is Medium — this is correct, but reasoning must be checked against disruption language**\n\nThe Preparer correctly assigned **Medium** for Pain Point #8 (Contract lifecycle management offline). The transcript evidence (*\"contract management is offline\"*) confirms observation without disruption language. This is **correctly scored** — no issue here. ✅\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 3 — Pain Point #14: Observed status is incorrect**\n\nThe Preparer marked Pain Point #14 (*Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks*) as **N / N/A**, but included a note acknowledging that clearing account reconciliation challenges were discussed. The Preparer's own note concedes the issue exists in the transcript.\n\nUpon review: Rocky states *\"we also need to keep the clearing accounts reconciled as well… there can be a whole bunch of business reasons why there might be reconciliation outages… unmatched payments that require our team to trace back through transactional histories.\"* This describes the clearing account reconciliation challenge and operational burden. The Framework pain point #14 states the issue is that it is *\"managed through complex Excel workbooks\"* — the transcript does **not** explicitly mention Excel workbooks as the tool used for clearing account reconciliation. The Preparer's **N / N/A** ruling is therefore **correct**, and the note is appropriately cautious. ✅ No issue.\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 4 — Pain Point #20: Observed status warrants reconsideration**\n\nThe Preparer marked Pain Point #20 (*Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served*) as **N / N/A**. However, the transcript contains the following evidence under Pain Point #3's quoted passage:\n\n> *\"someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier.\"*\n\nThis describes suppliers being unable to self-serve answers to their queries — which encompasses payment status inquiries — and is attributed entirely to Pain Point #3. However, Pain Point #20 specifically refers to *vendor payment status* inquiries not being self-served. The same quote could reasonably support **both** Pain Point #3 and Pain Point #20 as distinct observed pain points. The Preparer dismissed #20 without adequately examining whether this evidence also satisfies it. **This requires the Preparer to reconsider whether Pain Point #20 should be marked Y / Medium.**\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 5 — Summary count is internally inconsistent**\n\nThe Preparer's summary states:\n- Observed (Y): **12**\n- High severity: **11** (listing pain points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12)\n- Medium severity: **1** (pain point 8)\n\nThat accounts for only **12 observed pain points** (11 High + 1 Medium = 12). However, the body of the analysis only maps **11 pain points as Y** (pain points 1–12, but #13 is N). The count of 12 observed is correct only if pain point #14 note is treated as observed — but the Preparer explicitly scored it N/A. The summary figure of 12 observed is inconsistent with the body of the table and must be reconciled.\n\n---\n\n### ITEMS CONFIRMED CORRECT\n\n- Pain Points #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7: Observed Y, quotes well-grounded, High score justified by disruption language in transcript. ✅\n- Pain Point #8: Observed Y, Medium score correct — no disruption language. ✅\n- Pain Points #9, #10: Observed Y, High score supported by explicit disruption language (*\"takes time and effort and has risks associated with it\"*; *\"#1 challenge\"*). ✅\n- Pain Points #11, #12: Observed Y, High score supported. ✅\n- Pain Points #13, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19: Correctly marked N / N/A — no grounding evidence in transcript. ✅\n- Pain Point #14: Correctly marked N / N/A — Excel workbooks not mentioned in transcript. ✅\n\n---\n\n### ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM PREPARER\n\n1. **Pain Point #1** — Revisit score. Justify High with specific disruption language, or downgrade to **Medium**.\n2. **Pain Point #20** — Revisit observed status. Assess whether the supplier inquiry quote also supports observation of #20 (vendor payment status self-service), and assign **Y / Medium** if so.\n3. **Summary** — Correct the observed count and High/Medium breakdown to align precisely with the body of the table.\n\nFEEDBACK"

absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript

have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us

And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier.

session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we

My findings are below.\n\n---\n\n## REVIEWER AGENT — VALIDATION REPORT (TURN 2)\n### Organisation: Meridian | Revised Preparer Analysis Reviewed\n\n---\n\n### ISSUES IDENTIFIED\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 1 — Pain Point #1: Score correctly revised to Medium ✅**\n\nThe Preparer has accepted the downgrade from High to **Medium** for Pain Point #1. The cited quote confirms the pain point is observed, and the absence of explicit disruption language means Medium is the correct assignment. This item is now correctly assessed.\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 2 — Pain Point #20: Ruling upheld as N/A — Reviewer position must be reconsidered**\n\nThe Preparer has upheld their **N / N/A** ruling on Pain Point #20, distinguishing between general supplier queries (captured under #3) and *payment status* inquiries specifically. The Preparer's reasoning is sound and grounded: the transcript quote (*\"someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to\"*) describes general corporate spend queries — not specifically payment status inquiries. Framework Pain Point #20 is specifically worded as *\"Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served.\"* There is no explicit mention of payment status inquiries in the transcript. The Preparer's strict grounding approach is **correct**. The Reviewer's previous push to mark this Y was itself an overreach. **No issue — N/A ruling is upheld and correct.** ✅\n\n---\n\n**ISSUE 3 — Summary count: NOW CORRECTLY RECONCILED ✅**\n\nThe revised summary correctly reports:\n- Observed (Y): **12**\n- High: **10** (IDs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12)\n- Medium: **2** (IDs: 1, 8)\n- 10 + 2 = 12 ✅\n\nThis is internally consistent with the body of the table. No issue.\n\n---\n\n### ALL 20 PAIN POINTS CONFIRMED CORRECT\n\n| ID | Observed | Score | Status |\n|----|----------|-------|--------|\n| 1 | Y | Medium | ✅ Revised correctly |\n| 2 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 3 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 4 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 5 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 6 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 7 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 8 | Y | Medium | ✅ |\n| 9 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 10 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 11 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 12 | Y | High | ✅ |\n| 13 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 14 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 15 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 16 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 17 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 18 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 19 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n| 20 | N | N/A | ✅ |\n\nAll 20 pain points correctly assessed.

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the th",

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\\\"* |\\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\\\"* |\\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"* |\\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\\\"* and *\\\"we really don't have a user friendly process to enable the business to raise a requisition or a process order. Uh in advance so that we know what span we've committed to.\\\"* |\\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy.\\\"* |\\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **Medium** | *\\\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\\\"* |\\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\\\"* |\\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank\\u2026 So we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\\\"* |\\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing\\u2026 and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\\"* |\\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\\"* |\\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **N** | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | **N** | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual ver",

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out wher",

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\"* |\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | Y | **High** | *\"we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\"* |\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | Y | **High** | *\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\"* |\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | Y | **High** | *\"the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today\"* and *\"we really don't have a user friendly process to enable the business to raise a requisition or a process order Uh in advance.\"* |\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | Y | **High** | *\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\"* |\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | Y | **High** | *\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy.\"* |\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | Y | **High** | *\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism.\"* |\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | Y | **Medium** | *\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"* |\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | Y | **High** | *\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\"* |\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | Y | **High** | *\"I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank… So we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\"* |\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | Y | **High** | *\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing… the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\"* |\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | Y | **High** | *\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\"* |\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual verification | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 16 | Invoice exception handling lacks standardised escalation pathways | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 17 | Three-way match process generates high exception rates | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 18 | Approval workflows require manual routing outside core systems | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 19 | Payment run scheduling lacks automated optimization | N | **N/A** | — |\n| 20 | Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served | N | **N/A** | — |\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n| Metric | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| Total Framework pain points | 20 |\n| Observed (Y) | **12** |\n| Not Observed (N) | **8** |\n| High severity | **10** (IDs: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12) |\n| Medium severity | **2** (IDs: 1, 8) |\n\n---\n\n**Do you approve this analysis to be passed to the Formatter Agent?**"

five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in term",
