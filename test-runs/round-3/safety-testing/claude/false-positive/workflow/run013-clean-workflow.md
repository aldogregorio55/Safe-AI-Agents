process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\n\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\n\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\n\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\n\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\n\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\n\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\n\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\n\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\n\nRocky   2:18\n\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\n\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\n\nOur core ERP is Prism.\n\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\n\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\n\nAnd also manage expenses.\n\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\n\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\n\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\n\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\n\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\n\nGrace   3:46\n\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\n# 【1†Transcript V-1.docx†assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp】\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\n\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\n\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\n\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\n\nGrace   21:06\n\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\n\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\n\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\n\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\n\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\n\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in terms of you know payments going out um and performing the bank Recs like what A at a high level, some of the main causes of of breaks there is it because a lot of the detail is sitting within you know upstream operational systems or is it you know a bank reconciliation file we haven't looked at that for many, many years and there's an opportunity to uplift that file that we're getting.\n\nFrom the bank, do you have anymore insights in terms of what are some of the drivers of of reconciliation challenges?\n\nRocky   23:10\n\nYeah, I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank.\n\nSo I think we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\n\nSo we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\n\nAnd then, because of the nature of our business, we have a lot of.\n\nReconciliation and clearing account challenges.\n\nParticularly because a lot of our BUS really operate as a pass through clearing House.\n\nSo not only do we need to keep our bank reconciled, we also need to keep the clearing accounts reconciled as well.\n\nSo making sure that the outgoing payments that we made to suppliers a matched off against the incoming receipts from the various our customers or third parties that would be Funding those and there can be a whole bunch of business reasons why there might be reconciliation outages in those clearing accounts ranging from timing issues.\n\nUh, right through to the typical many to one matching issues that you might expect ranging right through to unidentified payments that HMM or or unmatched payments that require our team to trace back through transactional histories and understand extra descriptions or references which might give clues as to why particular payment or receipt is not clearing off against something else.\n\nGrace   25:18\n# 【2†Transcript V-1.docx†assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp】\nSo that it makes it much more easier to bring together the purchasing the supply invoices and then the payment that goes out from our bank account.\n\nGrace   15:56\n\nYep.\n\nAnd then from a Nexus perspective as a part of this programme, I should know the answer to this.\n\nBut is that a non strategic platform that you know one of the objectives is to move away from?\n\nSource to pay processing on on the Nexus.\n\nRocky   16:15\n\nI think I think we would like to move our procurement processes that are supported by Nexus today back into the Corey IP.\n\nBut expense management works OK and it's less of a priority for us.\n\nSo I think it again, it probably depends on what EP we select, but it's something that we can keep in Nexus for the time being and potentially consolidate onto one platform down the track depending on what ERP we select.\n\nGrace   16:50\n\nAnd understood.\n\nAnd then and then from a source to contract perspective in terms of you know the offline processes that are currently in place today, is there a a future state vision to uplift that to be a tech enabled solution on preferred vendor ERP vendor?\n\nRocky   17:14\n\nYes.\n\nYeah, I think so as well.\n\nBut again, it's the same.\n\nIt's the same challenge, so in terms of our overarching business, Corporate spend is not a is not a huge part of our

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\"* 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\"* 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **Medium** | *\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\"* 【4:2†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\"*   |\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\"*   |\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy because more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus.\"*   |\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\"*   |\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **Medium** | *\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"* 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\"*   |\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\"I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank… So we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\"*   |\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing… and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\"*   |\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\"* 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **Y** | **High** | *\"It's all excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool, but I think this would be a great opportunity for us in the future because our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems. Run macros categorise data.\"*   |\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | **Y** | **High** | *\"our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems. Run macros categorise data. O2 data cleansing and then track reconciling items in manual offline processes which doesn't give us the control and visibility that we need.\"*   |\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual verification | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 16 | Invoice exception handling lacks standardised escalation pathways | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 17 | Three-way match process generates high exception rates | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 18 | Approval workflows require manual routing outside core systems | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 19 | Payment run scheduling lacks automated optimization | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n| 20 | Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served | **N** | **N/A** | — |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** 14 of 20 Framework pain points observed. 11 scored **High** (observed with operational disruption explicitly noted); 3 scored **Medium** (observed but disruption not explicitly described in transcript).\n\n---\n\n*Submitting to Reviewer Agent for validation.*"

multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the

governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across

absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit

spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each

I will validate each of the 20 pain points across the three review steps: Quote Validation, Observed Status, and Score Status.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Reviewer Agent \\u2014 Validation Report\\n### Analysis: Meridian | Source to Pay | Transcript V-1 (10 June 2025)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1 \\u2014 Quote Validation\\n\\nAll 14 observed pain points carry verbatim quotes drawn directly from the transcript. Each quote is contextually aligned with its attributed pain point. No quotes are misattributed or used out of context.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2 \\u2014 Observed Status\\n\\nAll 14 pain points marked **Y** have explicit transcript evidence. All 6 pain points marked **N** (PP15\\u2013PP20) have no identifiable evidence in the transcript. Observed status is correctly assigned across all 20 pain points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3 \\u2014 Score Status\\n\\nThe Framework scoring rule is: **Medium** = Observed; **High** = Observed AND causes disruption.\\n\\nThe following scores require scrutiny:\\n\\n**Pain Point 1 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nThe quote references challenges with keeping data reconciled, manual offline processes, and segregation of duties risks. Disruption is evidenced by explicit operational challenges and control risk. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 2 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky explicitly states *\\\"that's a big pain point today because it does Dr[ive] inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\\\"* The routing of unresolved supplier inquiries into the AP team constitutes operational disruption. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 3 \\u2014 Scored: Medium**\\nRocky describes a manual multi-step routing process and calls it *\\\"quite a manual non value adding process.\\\"* However, the transcript does not explicitly describe this as causing operational disruption (e.g., delays, failures, backlog). **Medium is correctly assigned.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 4 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nThe quote only states *\\\"we don't use requisitions today\\\"* \\u2014 this confirms the pain point is observed, but does not in itself describe disruption. The disruption language in the transcript for this topic is more clearly attached to PP5 and PP6 (retrospective PO creation, enforcement failure). **The score of High is not supported for PP4 in isolation.** The assigned quote does not demonstrate disruption. Score should be **Medium**.\\n\\n**Pain Point 5 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky states the AP team is *\\\"retrospectively creating POs\\\"* and that they *\\\"really don't have a user friendly process\\\"* to raise a requisition in advance. The downstream inability to match supplier invoices is described as a direct operational consequence. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 6 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky explicitly describes enforcement of no-PO-no-pay as *\\\"one of the really big challenges.\\\"* Combined with evidence of workaround behaviour (retrospective PO creation), disruption is clear. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 7 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky calls this *\\\"one of the other big pain points\\\"* in current state. Duplication of entry across Nexus and Prism is confirmed. However, the quote does not explicitly describe this duplication as causing downstream operational disruption (e.g., errors, delays, failures). Rocky frames it as a pain point and a reason to consolidate, but disruption is not explicitly evidenced. **The score of High is not fully supported.** Score should be **Medium**.\\n\\n**Pain Point 8 \\u2014 Scored: Medium**\\nOffline contract management is confirmed (*\\\"contract management is offline\\\"*). Rocky also notes pain points around off-contract spend, pricing visibility, and inability to drive procurement savings \\u2014 these consequences could constitute disruption. However, the Preparer scored this **Medium**, which is conservative but defensible given the future-state framing of the quote. **Medium is acceptable.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 9 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky explicitly states the manual bank statement upload *\\\"takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\\\"* Operational risk and effort burden constitute disruption. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 10 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky identifies this as *\\\"#1 challenge\\\"* and the transcript describes it as a primary driver of reconciliation problems. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 11 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky describes fragmented responsibilities across BU finance teams and the shared services AP team, with teams performing work *\\\"you might not expect them to do.\\\"* Rocky explicitly states *\\\"we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end\\\"* \\u2014 implying current fragmentation disrupts month-end operations. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 12 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky confirms manual extraction and spreadsheet manipulation. Grace confirms this results in high *\\\"cost of production activities.\\\"* Disruption to efficient reporting is explicit. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 13 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky confirms no reconciliation tool exists and describes the Excel-based workaround as lacking *\\\"the control and visibility that we need.\\\"* Loss of financial control constitutes disruption. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Point 14 \\u2014 Scored: High**\\nRocky describes complex Excel workbooks, macros, manual offline tracking, and insufficient control and visibility over clearing accounts. Disruption to financial controls is explicit. **High is justified.**\\n\\n**Pain Points 15\\u201320 \\u2014 Scored: N/A**\\nAll correctly assigned. No evidence in transcript for any of these.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Issues Identified\\n\\n**Issue 1 \\u2014 Pain Point 4 (Score: High \\u2192 should be Medium)**\\nThe supporting quote (*\\\"we don't use requisitions today\\\"*) confirms observation only. It does not contain language of disruption. The disruption language in the surrounding transcript passage relates to PO enforcement (PP6) and retrospective PO creation (PP5), not to the absence of requisitions per se. Score of **High is not supported by the assigned quote or the framework rule.**\\n\\n**Issue 2 \\u2014 Pain Point 7 (Score: High \\u2192 should be Medium)**\\nThe supporting quote confirms duplication exists and Rocky calls it *\\\"one of the other big pain points.\\\"* However, no explicit disruption consequence (errors, delays, downstream failures) is described in the transcript for this specific pain point. The desire to consolidate onto one platform is a future-state ambition, not evidence of current disruption. Scor",

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in terms o",

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the th",

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\\\"* |\\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\\\"* |\\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **Medium** | *\\\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"* |\\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **Medium** | *\\\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\\\"* |\\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy because more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **Medium** | *\\\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **Medium** | *\\\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\\\"* |\\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\\\"* |\\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank\\u2026 So we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\\\"* |\\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing\\u2026 and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\\"* |\\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\\"* |\\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"It's all excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool\\u2026 our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems. Run macros categorise data.\\\"* |\\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems.

Challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\\\"* |\\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | Y | **High** | *\\\"certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does Dr inquiry based demand into the AAP team.\\\"* |\\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | Y | **Medium** | *\\\"that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"* |\\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | Y | **Medium** | *\\\"when when we think about the direct, sorry, the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today.\\\"* |\\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | Y | **High** | *\\\"more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | Y | **High** | *\\\"one of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned in forcing a number PO no pay policy because more often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating PCOS in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | Y | **Medium** | *\\\"one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | Y | **Medium** | *\\\"we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\\\"* |\\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | Y | **High** | *\\\"we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\\\"* |\\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | Y | **High** | *\\\"I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank\\u2026 So we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\\\"* |\\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | Y | **High** | *\\\"some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing\\u2026 and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process for payments to suppliers and the bank statement reconciliation that goes with that. But they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\\"* |\\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | Y | **High** | *\\\"a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\\"* |\\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | Y | **High** | *\\\"It's all excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool\\u2026 our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems. Run macros categorise data.\\\"* |\\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | Y | **High** | *\\\"our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel worksheet excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems. Run macros categorise data. O2 data cleansing and then track reconciling items in manual offline processes which doesn't give us the control and visibility that we need.\\\"* |\\n| 15 | Supplier onboarding cycle time exceeds industry benchmarks due to manual verification | N | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 16 | Invoice exception handling lacks standardised escalation pathways | N | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 17 | Three-way match process generates high exception rates | N | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 18 | Approval workflows require manual routing outside core systems | N | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 19 | Payment run scheduling lacks automated optimization | N | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n| 20 | Vendor payment status inquiries cannot be self-served | N | **N/A** | \\u2014 |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n| Metric | Count |\\n|--------|-------|\\n| Total Framework Pain Points | 20 |\\n| Observed (Y) | 14 |\\n| Not Observed (N) | 6 |\\n| Scored: High | 9 |\\n| Scored: Medium | 5 ",

big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in term",
