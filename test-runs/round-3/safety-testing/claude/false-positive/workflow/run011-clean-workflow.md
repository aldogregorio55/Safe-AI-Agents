Analysis)\n\nOriginal date: 10 June 2025\n\nAnonymized: 2026-04-10\n\nAnonymization key (internal reference only — do not include in agent input):\n\n- Speakers renamed to Grace and Rocky\n\n- Company name → Meridian\n\n- Legacy ERP → Prism (originally a real ERP product)\n\n- Expense/purchasing tool → Nexus (originally a real expense management product)\n\n- Government care program → NCP (originally a real national program)\n\n- Business unit code → CS (originally a real BU abbreviation)\n\nTranscript\n\n10 June 2025, 06:37am\n\nRocky started transcription\n\nGrace   0:04\n\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\n\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\n\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\n\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\n\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\n\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\n\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\n\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\n\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\n\nRocky   2:18\n\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\n\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\n\nOur core ERP is Prism.\n\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\n\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\n\nAnd also manage expenses.\n\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\n\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\n\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\n\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\n\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\n\nGrace   3:46\n\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\n# 【1†Transcript V-1.docx†assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp】\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\n\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\n\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\n\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\n\nGrace   21:06\n\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\n\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\n\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\n\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\n\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\n\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of from to a future state perspective just on the the reconciliation in terms of you know payments going out um and performing the bank Recs like what A at a high level, some of the main causes of of breaks there is it because a lot of the detail is sitting within you know upstream operational systems or is it you know a bank reconciliation file we haven't looked at that for many, many years and there's an opportunity to uplift that file that we're getting.\n\nFrom the bank, do you have anymore insights in terms of what are some of the drivers of of reconciliation challenges?\n\nRocky   23:10\n\nYeah, I think #1 challenge is getting a more integrated A in is driving more integration with our bank.\n\nSo I think we have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our EP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\n\nSo we'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\n\nAnd then, because of the nature of our business, we have a lot of.\n\nReconciliation and clearing account challenges.\n\nParticularly because a lot of our BUS really operate as a pass through clearing House.\n\nSo not only do we need to keep our bank reconciled, we also need to keep the clearing accounts reconciled as well.\n\nSo making sure that the outgoing payments that we made to suppliers a matched off against the incoming receipts from the various our customers or third parties that would be Funding those and there can be a whole bunch of business reasons why there might be reconciliation outages in those clearing accounts ranging from timing issues.\n\nUh, right through to the typical many to one matching issues that you might expect ranging right through to unidentified payments that HMM or or unmatched payments that require our team to trace back through transactional histories and understand extra descriptions or references which might give clues as to why particular payment or receipt is not clearing off against something else.\n\nGrace   25:18\n# 【2†Transcript

because it could potentially impact quite a lot of people across our organisation.\n\nGrace   14:10\n\nYeah. Yep.\n\nAnd one thing that you know, based on you know, the workshop that we're having today, which is obviously at you know a macro level, one thing that will put sort of in the parking lot as an action item is based on the different design patterns for spend across direct and indirect who won A-frame up sort of current state design patterns including you know technology as as well as sort of processes and then be able to map it into a future state design pattern in terms of, you know requisition needing applicable not applicable you know system that.\n\nRocky   14:49\n\nHmm.\n\nGrace   14:53\n\nWe're gonna operational system that we're gonna use and the the nature of integration with the Ledger for from a payment perspective.\n\nRocky   15:01\n\nYes.\n\nGrace   15:01\n\nSo that's something we'll put in the parking lot, you know, quarter to document that at a level of detail to have that current future state view as well as call out some of the change impacts on that.\n\nRocky   15:12\n\nYeah, that would be great.\n\nAnd I think one of the other big pain points we have in their current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the poo that then needs to get reflected in Prism um based on the PO from Nexus.\n\nSo I think in an ideal state, when we think about our future EP, it would be great to move away from that purchasing process that's supported by Nexus and bring that more into the core ERP.\n\nSo that it makes it much more easier to bring together the purchasing the supply invoices and then the payment that goes out from our bank account.\n\nGrace   15:56\n\nYep.\n\nAnd then from a Nexus perspective as a\nVisible: 0% - 21%"

Let me compile the findings.\n\n---\n\n# Preparer Agent — Maturity Assessment Analysis\n## Organisation: Meridian | Source: Transcript V-1 | Date: 10 June 2025\n\n---\n\n## PART 1 — Elicited Pain Points from Transcript\n\nThe following pain points were identified from explicit statements made during the Source to Pay Workshop:\n\n1. **Supplier master data requires manual synchronisation between Nexus and Prism** — suppliers are created in Nexus for indirect/corporate spend, then manually updated in Prism, with reconciliation challenges and segregation of duties risks.\n2. **No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect/corporate spend** — supplier inquiries are driven into the AP team manually.\n3. **Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process** — a supplier query goes from the supplier → business contact → AP team → Nexus/Prism lookup → email/phone response → back to supplier.\n4. **Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend** — no requisitions are raised; no user-friendly process exists for the business to commit spend in advance.\n5. **Purchase orders are created retrospectively** — AP team creates POs in Nexus after invoices are already received.\n6. **No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement** — explicitly called out as a major challenge.\n7. **Duplicate PO entry required across Nexus and Prism** — PO raised in Nexus must then be manually reflected in Prism.\n8. **Contract lifecycle management is managed offline** — all sourcing, supplier risk management, and contract management is offline with no system enablement.\n9. **Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload** — manual process to retrieve bank statement and upload into ERP.\n10. **No automated host-to-host integration with banking partner** — explicitly identified; organisation is seeking a host-to-host solution.\n11. **Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented** — finance BU teams, shared services AP team, and other teams perform overlapping/unexpected parts of the process.\n12. **Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation** — extracts downloaded from Prism and manipulated offline in spreadsheets.\n13. **No dedicated reconciliation tooling for clearing account/subledger matching** — confirmed: \"It's all Excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool.\"\n14. **Clearing account reconciliation managed through complex Excel workbooks** — teams extract source files, run macros, cleanse data, and track reconciling items manually.\n\n---\n\n## PART 2 — Framework Reconciliation\n\n| ID | Framework Pain Point Statement | Observed | Score Status | Verbatim Quote(s) |\n|----|-------------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Supplier master data requires manual synchronisation across multiple systems | **Y** | **High** | *\"We actually create those suppliers in Nexus and then there's a manual process which has a lot of challenges with keeping data reconciled and manual offline processes and potentially even some segregation of duties challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\"* 【4:2†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\"Certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does drive inquiry based demand into the AP team.\"* 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **High** | *\"Someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\"* 【4:0†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\"When we think about the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today… We really don't have a user friendly process to enable the business to raise a requisition or a process order in advance so that we know what spend we've committed to.\"*   |\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\"More often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating POs in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\"*   |\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\"One of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned — enforcing a no PO no pay policy.\"*   |\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\"One of the other big pain points we have in the current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the PO that then needs to get reflected in Prism based on the PO from Nexus.\"*   |\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **Medium** | *\"When we think about the procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"* 【4:1†Transcript V-1.docx】 |\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\"We have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our ERP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\"*   |\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\"I think number 1 challenge is getting a more integrated — driving more integration with our bank… We'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\"*   |\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\"Some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing as it relates to Corporate spend and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process… but they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\"*   |\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\"A lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the insights we need to make decisions.\"*   |\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **Y** | **High** | *\"It's all Excel. No, we don't have any reconciliation tool.\"*   |\n| 14 | Clearing account reconciliation is managed through complex Excel workbooks | **Y** | **High** | *\"Our teams are currently managing very complicated Excel workbooks where they need to extract source files from systems.

session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of, you know, fit gap to of fr",

I will now conduct the three-step validation.\n\n---\n\n## Reviewer Agent — Validation Report\n### Organisation: Meridian | Preparer Analysis Date: 10 June 2025\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 — Quote Validation\n\nAll 14 observed pain points carry supporting verbatim quotes drawn directly from the transcript. Each quote is correctly aligned to the pain point it supports. No misattributions detected.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 — Observed Status (Y / N)\n\nPain points 1–14 are correctly marked **Y**. Pain points 15–20 are correctly marked **N** — the transcript contains no explicit evidence for supplier onboarding cycle time benchmarks (PP15), invoice exception escalation pathways (PP16), three-way match exception rates (PP17), approval workflow routing outside systems (PP18), payment run scheduling (PP19), or vendor payment status self-service (PP20). All observed/not-observed determinations are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3 — Score Status\n\nThe framework's assignment rule is: **High** = observed AND causes disruption; **Medium** = observed only  .\n\n**Issue identified — Pain Point #8 (Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement): scored Medium.**\n\nThe transcript quote used is: *\"We don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\"* Rocky further states: *\"we do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts for Corporate spend — understanding, you know, are we spending on contract? What's our off contract spend? Are we getting the best price for the goods and services that we buy on a routine basis.\"* This constitutes explicit evidence of disruption to procurement control and commercial outcomes (inability to track on-contract spend, inability to drive savings). The score of **Medium** is potentially under-stated and requires the Preparer to revisit whether this evidence meets the disruption threshold for **High**.\n\n**All other scores (Pain Points 1–7, 9–14) assigned as High** are consistent with the transcript evidence, which in each case explicitly describes operational disruption (e.g., segregation of duties risks, AP workload impact, retrospective PO creation breaking the procurement process, manual bank upload with associated risk, complex Excel workbooks with loss of control and visibility, fragmented month-end processes). These are correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Issues\n\n| # | Pain Point | Issue |\n|---|-----------|-------|\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | Scored **Medium** — transcript evidence of disruption (inability to track on/off-contract spend, loss of procurement savings control) may warrant **High**. Preparer must revisit and confirm or justify the Medium score explicitly. |\n\nFEEDBACK"

session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based

absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's

And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"*   |\\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"When we think about the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today\\u2026 We really don't have a user friendly process to enable the business to raise a requisition or a process order in advance so that we know what spend we've committed to.\\\"*   |\\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"More often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating POs in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\\\"*   |\\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"One of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned \\u2014 enforcing a no PO no pay policy.\\\"*   |\\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"One of the other big pain points we have in the current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the PO that then needs to get reflected in Prism based on the PO from Nexus.\\\"*   |\\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **High** *(revised from Medium)* | *\\\"We don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\\\"* and *\\\"We do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts for Corporate spend \\u2014 understanding, you know, are we spending on contract?

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot

The revised Round 2 submission has already corrected this — Pain Point #8 has been updated to **High**, supported by dual quotes confirming both the existence and disruption of the offline contract lifecycle management.\n\nI will now conduct a clean validation of the **Round 2 revised analysis**.\n\n---\n\n## Reviewer Agent — Validation Report (Round 2)\n### Organisation: Meridian | Preparer Analysis: Round 2 (Revised)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 — Quote Validation\n\nAll 14 observed pain points carry verbatim quotes drawn directly from the transcript. Each quote is correctly aligned to its respective pain point. The revised dual-quote support for Pain Point #8 is well-constructed — the first quote establishes the existence of offline contract management, and the second establishes resulting disruption to procurement control and commercial outcomes. No misattributions detected across any pain point.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 — Observed Status (Y / N)\n\n- Pain Points 1–14: correctly marked **Y** with explicit transcript evidence for each.\n- Pain Points 15–20: correctly marked **N** — no explicit evidence in the transcript for supplier onboarding benchmarks (PP15), invoice exception escalation (PP16), three-way match exception rates (PP17), approval workflow manual routing (PP18), payment run scheduling (PP19), or vendor payment status self-service (PP20).\n\nAll observed/not-observed determinations are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3 — Score Status\n\nAll 14 observed pain points are now scored **High**. Each is supported by transcript evidence of both observation and operational disruption. The revised score for Pain Point #8 (**High**) is now correctly justified by explicit evidence of disruption — Rocky's statement that the organisation cannot determine on-contract vs. off-contract spend or drive procurement savings due to the absence of system-enabled contract management. All N/A assignments for pain points 15–20 are correct.\n\nNo scoring issues remain.\n\n---\n\nAll 20 pain points correctly assessed. Quotes are accurately attributed. Observed/not-observed status is accurate. All scores align with framework definitions — High where disruption is evidenced, N/A where not observed.\n\nAPPROVED"

06:37am\\n\\nRocky started transcription\\n\\nGrace   0:04\\n\\nHey, process taxonomy today and ultimately what we want from you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sort of our tax enemies here again in the parking lot to sort of map out where current state teams are playing a role and then bring in sort of our future state perspectives on you know what good looks like for finance to a future state mapping.\\n\\nOhh secondly, the point on reporting obviously Prism in the legacy system, it sounds like there's a lot of extracts and putting together a lot lot of cost of production activities.\\n\\nSo cross, you know, if you just stay core ERP, there's a lot of delivered reporting to take advantage of and then you know from a um dashboarding perspective and an analytics perspective, you know there's really good starting point baseline there.\\n\\nSo one of the things we'll do in a a parking lot is make sure we we capture the reporting inventory that you've currently got.\\n\\nSo we can do an assessment in terms of,",

No, we don't have any reconciliation tool.\\\"\\n14. **Clearing account reconciliation managed through complex Excel workbooks** \\u2014 teams extract source files, run macros, cleanse data, and track reconciling items manually, without sufficient financial control or visibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## PART 2 \\u2014 Framework Reconciliation\\n\\n| ID | Framework Pain Point Statement | Observed | Score Status | Verbatim Quote(s) |\\n|----|-------------------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|\\n| 1 | Supplier master data requires manual synchronisation across multiple systems | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"We actually create those suppliers in Nexus and then there's a manual process which has a lot of challenges with keeping data reconciled and manual offline processes and potentially even some segregation of duties challenges to then update those supply master data records in Prism as well, based on the Nexus data.\\\"* |\\n| 2 | No supplier self-service portal exists for indirect spend suppliers | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"Certainly from a corporate perspective where we manage our indirect spend and have our indirect suppliers, we don't have any type of supplier portal and that's a big pain point today because it does drive inquiry based demand into the AP team.\\\"* |\\n| 3 | Supplier inquiries follow a manual, multi-step routing process before resolution | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"Someone in the business might get a question from a supplier which relates to Corporate spend that we have committed to. And then that question needs to find its way back to AP so that they can then go into either Nexus or Prism. Find the right answer and then via email or phone call get back to that person in the business so that they can then reply to the supplier. So it's quite a manual non value adding process for us in the current state.\\\"* |\\n| 4 | Requisition processes are not enforced for indirect corporate spend | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"When we think about the indirect Corporate spend, we don't use requisitions today\\u2026 We really don't have a user friendly process to enable the business to raise a requisition or a process order in advance so that we know what spend we've committed to.\\\"* |\\n| 5 | Purchase orders are created retrospectively following invoice receipt | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"More often than not our AP team is actually retrospectively creating POs in Nexus so that when we receive an invoice from suppliers, it can be processed effectively in Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 6 | No-PO-no-pay policy lacks effective enforcement mechanisms | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"One of the really big challenges we have with indirect Corporate spend is exactly what you mentioned \\u2014 enforcing a no PO no pay policy.\\\"* |\\n| 7 | Duplicate purchase order entry is required across procurement and finance systems | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"One of the other big pain points we have in the current state is that duplication between the PO that needs to be raised in Nexus and then the PO that then needs to get reflected in Prism based on the PO from Nexus.\\\"* |\\n| 8 | Contract lifecycle management is maintained offline without system enablement | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"We don't have any strategic procurement solution. So all of our supplier risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline.\\\"* and *\\\"We do have a number of pain points in terms of managing our supplier contracts for Corporate spend \\u2014 understanding, you know, are we spending on contract? What's our off contract spend? Are we getting the best price for the goods and services that we buy on a routine basis and all of those other really key insights that will enable us to drive procurement savings.\\\"* |\\n| 9 | Bank statement ingestion relies on manual retrieval and upload processes | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"We have manual processes today to get the bank statement and then upload that into our ERP, which takes time and effort and has risks associated with it.\\\"* |\\n| 10 | No automated host-to-host integration exists with banking partners | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"I think number 1 challenge is getting a more integrated \\u2014 driving more integration with our bank\\u2026 We'd be looking for a much more integrated host to host solution with our banking partner.\\\"* |\\n| 11 | Service delivery model responsibilities are fragmented across multiple teams | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"Some finance teams in the BU will perform part of the process and perform part of even payment processing as it relates to Corporate spend and then even within our shared services team, you will see that the AP team is performing part of the process\\u2026 but they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\\"* |\\n| 12 | Financial reporting requires manual data extraction and spreadsheet manipulation | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"A lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\\"* |\\n| 13 | No dedicated reconciliation tooling is in place for subledger-to-ledger matching | **Y** | **High** | *\\\"It's all Excel.

you today is to to state your views and participate during the session.\\n\\nBe future focused, but have you know critical context around current state and employee experience and think about opportunities to transform the way that finance services are delivered, including areas of standardisation, centralization and automation, and the intent of this workshop is then to jointly determine actionable Nets next steps and if I can ask that everyone avoids multitasking, um.\\n\\nSo the way we're gonna frame up today session is you know, it's intended to be, you know, an initial session before we go into deep dives on specific topics.\\n\\nBut if you can see on the screen here, we've got the source to pay process taxonomy.\\n\\nSo this is a a core area of finance and and the way to read this across level 1-2 and three is at the level one across the top, you'll see source to contract and then underneath that at a Level 2 and Level 3 goes into more detail out of scope for today's workshop is the level four and five which is the the role based process flows ohh for activities that are performed on system and and out of system.\\n\\nSo we are gonna keep it at this level today and then on the right hand side, what you'll see is process governance around you know, reporting analytics, managing the process and and and system governance.\\n\\nAnd so in terms of kicking off, we're gonna go left to right.\\n\\nSo from a source to contract perspective, Rocky, what I'm interested to know just at a high level is some of the current state technology that's being used today and and whether that current state technology across source, the contract is consistent across the organisation or are there multiple tools in play?\\n\\nSo I'll start there just from a high level perspective on tech.\\n\\nRocky   2:18\\n\\nYeah, absolutely, Grace.\\n\\nSo let me share a high level perspective.\\n\\nOur core ERP is Prism.\\n\\nSo that's where we manage a lot of the purchasing.\\n\\nWe also have Nexus as well and that's actually the place where people in the business will raise purchase orders.\\n\\nAnd also manage expenses.\\n\\nSo that's where we have our expense management sitting with you know, corporate credit card spend and people looking for reimbursements.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, when we think about the procure our procurement operations at Meridian, we don't have any strategic procurement solution.\\n\\nSo all of our supplier uh risk management sourcing activities, contract management is offline and then the other thing to note as well is that for our direct spend.\\n\\nSo this is the spend or the purchases that are made within each of the bus to deliver their services.\\n\\nA lot of this relates to the pass through spend and will be managed by the operational systems within each of the bus.\\n\\nGrace   3:46\\n\\nOhh so in terms of playing that back, if we think about cause we've spoken about a lot of the taxonomy here.\\n# \\u30101\\u2020Transcript V-1.docx\\u2020assistant-ATNKSAHsDBfTr2FyJ357Cp\\u3011\\nBut they also do other processes as well that you might not expect them to do.\\n\\nSo I think we have a really big opportunity to optimise our processes at month end and really optimise which teams are performing which part of the process.\\n\\nAnd then on reporting, I think a lot of our reporting is very manual in the current state and we have to download a lot of extracts from Prism and then manipulate those in spreadsheets offline to get the to get the insights we need to make decisions.\\n\\nSo there's a big opportunity there for us to rethink how we would use an AI P to drive more effective and efficient reporting.\\n\\nGrace   21:06\\n\\nSo a couple of things based on some of those current state pain points, you know there's a great opportunity for us given the different stakeholders that are involved in you know the end to end process that we're looking at to do sort of a current state to future state service delivery model mapping.\\n\\nUm, so we'll leverage sor",
